                    <p>C++ is a cross-platform language, created by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b>, that can be used to create high-performance applications. It is an object-oriented programming language, which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering therefore development costs.</p>
                    <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</p>

                    <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>
                    <p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
                        <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
                        <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
                        <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Tip</b>: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has <b>attributes</b>, such as weight and color, and <b>methods</b>, such as drive and brake.</p>
                    <p>Attributes and methods are basically <b>variables</b> and <b>functions</b> that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".</p>
                    <p>A <b>class</b> is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, which works as a template for objects. 
                    <p>An <b>object</b> is an instance of a class.</p>
                    <p>Here is an example of a class with multiple objects:</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            // Create a Car class with some attributes
                            class Car {
                                public:
                                    string brand;   
                                    string model;
                                    int year;
                                };

                            int main() {
                                // Create an object of Car
                                Car carObj1;
                                carObj1.brand = "BMW";
                                carObj1.model = "X5";
                                carObj1.year = 1999;

                                // Create another object of Car
                                Car carObj2;
                                carObj2.brand = "Ford";
                                carObj2.model = "Mustang";
                                carObj2.year = 1969;

                    <p>Methods are functions that belong to the class.</p>
                    <p>There are two ways to define functions that belong to a class:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inside class definition</li>
                        <li>Outside class definition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name it <b>"myMethod"</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>Note</b>: You access methods just like you access attributes; by creating an object of the class and using the dot syntax (.):</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            class MyClass {        // The class
                                public:              // Access specifier
                                  void myMethod() {  // Method/function defined inside the class
                                  cout << "Hello World!";
                                }
                            };
                              
                            int main() {
                                MyClass myObj;     // Create an object of MyClass
                                myObj.myMethod();  // Call the method

                    </pre>
                    <p>To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the name of the class, followed the scope resolution <b>::</b> operator, followed by the name of the function:</p>

              <article>
                <p>Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed.</p>
                <p>In C++, there are three access specifiers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>public</b> - members are accessible from outside the class</li>
                    <li><b>private</b> - the default specifier, which makes members that use it not accessible (or viewable) outside the class</li>
                    <li><b>protected</b> - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. See below more information about <b><a href="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a></b>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is an example of code that uses public and private specifiers:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        class MyClass {
                            public:    // Public access specifier
                              int x;   // Public attribute
                            private:   // Private access specifier
                              int y;   // Private attribute
                        };
                          
                        int main() {
                            MyClass myObj;
                            myObj.x = 25;  // Allowed (public)
                            myObj.y = 50;  // Not allowed (private)
                            return 0;
                        }

                <p><b>Note</b>: It is possible to access private members of a class using a public method inside the same class. See the next chapter (Encapsulation) on how to do this.</p>
                <p><b>Tip</b>: It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). This will reduce the possibility of yourself (or others) to mess up the code. This is also the main ingredient of the Encapsulation concept, about which you can read more just below.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.</p>
                    <p>Why encapsulation?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is considered good practice to declare your class attributes as private (as often as you can). Encapsulation ensures better control of your data, because you (or others) can change one part of the code without affecting other parts</li>
                        <li>Increased security of data</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To access a private attribute, use public "get" and "set" methods:</p>

                    <p>Explanation of the above example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <b>salary</b> attribute is private, which have restricted access</li>
                        <li>The public <b>setSalary()</b> method takes a parameter <b>(s)</b> and assigns it to the salary attribute (salary = s)</li>
                        <li>The public <b>getSalary()</b> method returns the value of the private salary attribute</li>
                        <li>Inside <b>main()</b>, we create an object of the <b>Employee</b> class. Now we can use the setSalary() method to set the value of the private attribute to 50000. Then we call the getSalary() method on the object to return the value</li>

                    <p>In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories.</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li><b>derived class (child)</b> - the class that inherits from another class</li>

                   <p>You learned from the <a href="#Access_specifiers">Access Specifiers</a> chapter that there are three specifiers available in C++. Until now, we have only used public (members of a class are accessible from outside the class) and private (members can only be accessed within the class). The third specifier, protected, is similar to private, but it can also be accessed in the inherited class:</p>

                    <p>Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.</p>
                    <p>Like we specified in the previous chapter; <a href="#Inheritance">inheritance</a> lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. <b>Polymorphism</b> uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.</p>
                    <p>For example, think of a base class called <b>Animal</b> that has a method called <b>animalSound()</b>. Derived classes of Animals could be <b>Pigs</b>, <b>Cats</b>, <b>Dogs</b> or <b>Birds</b> and they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (<b>the pig oinks</b>, <b>the cat meows</b> etc.):</p>

                    <p>Remember from the <a href="#Inheritance">Inheritance</a> chapter that we use the <b>:</b> symbol to inherit from a class.</p>
                    <p>Now we can create Pig and Dog objects and override the animalSound() method:</p>

                    <p>Why and when to use "inheritance" and "polymorphism"?
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is useful for code reusability: reuse attributes and methods of an existing class when you create a new class</li>
                    </ul>
